# LBR-sex-interactions

This repository is a supplement to *Deciphering sex-specific genetic architectures
using local Bayesian regressions* by Funkhouser et al. It contains two sections:
1. A [tutorial](LBR_tutorial.md) for fitting LBR with sex interactions
2. A [script](sim_data.md) for generating simulated data that was used in the original
manuscript
